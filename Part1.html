        <h2>What is the idea that you have for your app?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A webapp where people get to spend a few more minutes with a lost loved one, get to tell them all they want, and how much they miss them. </li>
            <li>Basically, talking to them to ones heartâ€™s content. Spending moments reliving cherished memories.   </li>
        </ul>
    

        <h2>What part is 2D and what part is 3D?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inputting information like photos, videos, voice recordings etc. This will allow for the best possible replication of the character. - 2D </li>
            <li>The experience will involve interacting with a 3D character of their loved one. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is your original, simple, hypothesis about this app</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Giving people a chance to relive memories/experiences of a loved one. Going back in time, and having time suspended/paused just for a moment with them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why is this idea important or needed in the world?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It gives people a chance to say/do things they never did or regret doing so they can move on. One benefit of having the opportunity to revisit past situations is being able to address matters left unresolved or decisions made with regret, ultimately allowing individuals to move forward.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do you plan to use XR emotionally to immerse the user in the experience?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Using VR to create an immersive experience</li>
            <li>Using MR to create a union of the physical and digital (eg having a phone call session while eating) </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not good for XR.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It's good for XR cause of the immersive experience</li>
            <li>Because of the connection that can be created between the physical and digital environments using MR.</li>
            <li>The expereience/ memory being relived doesn't current exist in time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>List 3 reasons why this idea is or is not better in 3D</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Different environments can be created</li>
            <li>Creating a fulll/immersive experience like you would if they were alive.</li>
            <li>The expereience/ memory being relived doesn't currently exist in time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>In what way is each of AR, MR and VR possibly useful for the project?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>VR - For a immersive/uninterruptede expereience</li>
            <li>MR - 3D + Physical environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Auditing your idea (page 61)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Does your idea exist in 2D? - Not that i know of (Maybe written letters can count)</li>
            <li>Does your idea exist in 3D? - Not that I know of.</li>
            <li>What could you do in your project in 3D that you can't do in 2D? - creating a realistic, immersive expereience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Add some of these design principles to your hypothesis (page 88)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Useful - Though not for everyday use but for occassional use, to possibly help people relive cherished moments with loved ones.</li>
            <li>Usable -  </li>
            <li>Desirable - reliving memeories, moving past regrets/things unsaid. </li>
            <li>Valuable - Less regrets, possibly overcoming some PTSD  </li>
            <li>Findable - Clean and minimalist  webapp, with emphasis on the Virtual and 3D experiences. </li>
            <li>Accessible and Inclusive - Different environmnets (eg sitting, standing etc) </li>
        </ul>
